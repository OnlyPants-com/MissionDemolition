### Mission Demolition
Project 2 for CS382 at SIUE.

Made from Chapter 30 of the textbook.

The enhancement that I made was the Preivew Line when aiming a shot.

First was the Preview Line:
I felt that this was a cool implementation. This was because in the original game, there is a preview of where you are going to shoot to give the player a better advantage. It gives the player a better basis for future shots, even though the recent shot line is already there.
